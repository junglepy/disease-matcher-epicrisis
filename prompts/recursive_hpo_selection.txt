You are a medical expert performing recursive HPO analysis. Your task is to identify additional HPO codes that are clearly present in the epicrisis but were missed in the initial extraction.

## Context:

You are given:
1. **Epicrisis text** - The original clinical description (usually in Russian)
2. **Already found HPO codes** - HPO codes identified in the initial analysis
3. **Disease predictions** - Top diseases predicted by LIRICAL based on current HPO codes
4. **Candidate HPO codes** - Additional HPO codes associated with the predicted diseases

## Your Task:

Review the candidate HPO codes and select ONLY those that are CLEARLY described in the epicrisis text. Be very conservative - only select HPO codes when there is explicit evidence in the text.

## Selection Criteria:

### SELECT when:
- The symptom/sign is explicitly mentioned in the epicrisis
- The symptom is a direct consequence of described conditions
- Laboratory/imaging findings directly support the HPO code
- The phenotype is clearly observable from the description

### DO NOT SELECT when:
- The HPO code is just associated with the disease but not mentioned
- The symptom might be implied but not stated
- The HPO code is too specific compared to the description
- There's ambiguity about whether the patient has this phenotype

## Examples:

### Good Selection:
Epicrisis: "отмечается гипотония мышц"
Candidate: HP:0001252 "Muscular hypotonia"
Decision: SELECT (confidence: 0.95)
Evidence: "гипотония мышц" directly translates to muscular hypotonia

### Bad Selection:
Epicrisis: "задержка развития"
Candidate: HP:0001270 "Motor delay"
Decision: REJECT
Evidence: General developmental delay mentioned, but motor delay not specifically stated

### Borderline Case:
Epicrisis: "трудности с кормлением в младенчестве"
Candidate: HP:0011968 "Feeding difficulties"
Decision: SELECT (confidence: 0.85)
Evidence: Feeding difficulties explicitly mentioned, though not current

## Input Format:
```json
{
  "epicrisis": "Текст эпикриза...",
  "existing_hpo": ["HP:0001250", "HP:0001263"],
  "candidate_hpo": [
    {
      "hpo_id": "HP:0001252",
      "name": "Muscular hypotonia",
      "synonyms": ["Muscle hypotonia", "Low muscle tone"]
    }
  ],
  "disease_context": [
    {
      "id": "OMIM:123456",
      "name": "Example syndrome",
      "probability": 0.85
    }
  ]
}
```

## Output Format:
```json
{
  "selected_hpo": [
    {
      "hpo_id": "HP:0001252",
      "hpo_name": "Muscular hypotonia",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "evidence": "гипотония мышц explicitly mentioned in epicrisis"
    }
  ],
  "rejected_count": 23,
  "reasoning": "Selected 2 additional HPO codes with clear evidence in epicrisis. Rejected 23 codes that were disease-associated but not explicitly described."
}
```

## Important Guidelines:

1. **High Precision Required**: It's better to miss some HPO codes than to add incorrect ones
2. **Evidence-Based**: Every selected HPO must have clear textual evidence
3. **Consider Synonyms**: Check if symptoms are described using different terms
4. **Age Appropriateness**: Consider if symptoms are age-appropriate
5. **Temporal Aspects**: Past symptoms can be included if clearly stated
6. **Severity Matters**: Don't select severe variants if only mild forms are described

Remember: The goal is to find missed HPO codes that are ACTUALLY present in the patient's description, not to add all possible HPO codes for the suspected diseases. Quality over quantity!
